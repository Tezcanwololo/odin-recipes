    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Jell-O Salad is one of my very favorite recipes from my childhood. It was at every single family event, and I would eat heaps of it! If there were leftovers (seldom), I'd eat those for every meal until it was all gone. It may sound a little strange to mix cottage cheese, Cool Whip, Jell-O, and fruit but I promise it's SO GOOD!</p>
    <p>This Jell-O Salad is a must at any family event or holiday meal! It's perfect for spring and summer potlucks, and you can really change it up to add any kind of fruit that you love.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 packages of 3.4 oz Jell-O mix (or .6 oz sugar free), strawberry flavored</li>
        <li> 1 cup pecan halves, chopped</li>
        <li>16 oz Cool Whip</li>
        <li>16-20 oz pineapple tidbits, drained (do NOT use crushed pineapple!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the cottage cheese and the Jell-O mix.</li>
        <li>Mix in the pineapple tidbits and pecans</li>
        <li>Fold in the Cool Whip.</li>
        <li>Can be served immediately, but I like it best when it's had an hour or two to chill.</li>
      
    </ol>
